## Overview

### The challenge

This MATLAB code is a part of my aero design course's project where the goal was to create a concept aircraft that follows a given set of project guidelines. This code computes the necessary calculations required to determine initial sizing of the aircraft, maximum take-off weight, optimum engine, and the max load factor that the aircraft can achieve at various speeds.

## My process

### Built with

- MATLAB

### What I learned

I learned about the calculations involved in designing an aircraft as well as the capabilities of MATLAB to perform math calculations and plot data easily.
